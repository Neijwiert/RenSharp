    <description>C++/CLI wrapper for Command and Conquer Renegade Dragonade FDS manager</description>
    <releaseNotes>
	- Got rid of some comments that weren't correct
	- Made the RenSharp manager classes final
	- Introduced a dispatcher (Engine.Dispatcher). This is a helper class that will let you execute stuff on the main Renegade thread. Useful for multithreaded applications. This dispatcher is unique per thread.
	- Added W3DSurfaceType enum and SurfaceTypeStrings to Engine, which reflects the surface stuff in w3d.h
	- Prevent over resizing of the priority queue in the Renegade Dispatcher
	- The FDS now always exits whenever a RenSharp shutdown is requested
	- OBBoxCollisionTestClass did not copy the box and move in one of its constructors
	- Added ability to reset a CastResultStruct upon construction. This is important as Fraction needs to be 1.0f for collision tests to actually work.
	- Fixed the Equals method on some classes that have multiple inheritance and the RenSharpGameObjObserverClass
	- Fixed wrong argument bounds checks in DATokenClass
	- Fixed memory leak in Engine.GetCurrentMusicTrack
	- Made sure that when the managed console functions are deleted that its properly sorted internally
	- Removed constructors of physics test classes that take a CastResultStruct argument. This is to avoid confusion that it is not changed by reference.
